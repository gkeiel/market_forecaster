# Market Forecaster

This project provides a Python tool for **backtesting and selecting the best-performing strategies** to spot market time series, applying only **machine learning algorithms**.

As main advantages, the project provides:
- uses **supervised machine learning** to generate trading signals.
- **recurring trading signals via Telegram** channel.
- **open-source code**, allowing **flexibility in specifying** machine learning models and comparing all strategies.

Telegram open channel with daily signals run via GitHub Actions. Anyone can sign up to get a feel for what this bot can offer.

## 📊 Features

- **Data download**: Downloads market data through the Yahoo Finance API.
- **Machine-learning-based indicators**: Implements machine-learning-based strategies to identify possible trends.
- **Strategy backtesting**: Runs historical backtests, generating figures and summaries for decision-making.
- **Performance evaluation**: Assesses results using a weighted objective function and ranks the best strategies.
- **Predict future prices**: Make predictions based on supervised machine learning, applying applying statistical models or non-parametric algorithmic models.
- **Configuration files**: Uses `.env` for private environment variables, `.json` for tickers list, `.json`for indicators list, and `.csv` for strategies list.

## 📈 Available Strategies

The project currently supports **supervisioned machine learning** strategies for generating trading signals, using the following methods:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Trees Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- **Extra Trees Regressor**
- **K Neighbors Regressor**
- **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)** models


These options allow the user to compare the performance of different approaches within the selected market.

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
    pip install pandas
    pip install numpy
    pip install yfinance
    pip install requests
    pip install python-dotenv
    pip install scikit-learn
    pip install statsmodels
    ```

2. **Configure tickers and indicators**
   - In `config.json` add the various configuration parameters.
   - In `tickers.json` add the stock codes to analyze.
   - In `indicators.json` add the indicators to generate.
   - In `strategies.csv` list the stocks to generate trading signals, each with its corresponding best strategy.

3. **Configure Telegram**
   - Create a Telegram bot and obtain its `TOKEN`.
   - Create a Telegram channel and obtain its `CHAT_ID`.
   - Add the bot as channel administrator.
   - Add keys to `.env` file to be read by `market_forecaster.py`.

4. **Run the script**
   - To run the batch of backtests, execute:
     ```bash
     python market_forecaster.py
     ```

## 🖼️ Output Examples

- **Backtest chart with Random Forest**
  
  After running `market_forecaster.py` it generates strategy charts, spreadsheets for each ticker, and a summary with results sorted by best. The generated figures follow the example below:

      <img width="733" height="395" alt="B3SA3_RF_50_5_5_backtest" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/379c078e-e68b-4edc-957c-16f9efbaf072" />
   </p>
  
  Notice that the asset ends the evaluated period near its initial price, so a Buy & Hold strategy would yield approximately a zero return. On the other hand, strictly following the machine learning strategy with Random Forest Regressor would produce above 160% return over the same period, excluding any trasactions fees. Furthermore, short selling operations are being considered by default in calculations, though they can easily be disabled in the backtest.
